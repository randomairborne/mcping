    <h1>MCping API</h1>
    <p>
      The MCping API is very simple. There is a Java API at /api/java/, and a
      bedrock api at /api/bedrock/. To specify what server to ping, you append
      that server to the end of the URL, like so.
    </p>
    <a href="/api/java/mcping.me">/api/java/mcping.me</a>
    <br />
    <p>
      The response will look like so, with an "icon" base64 PNG field added if
      the server has an icon. The latency is in mlliseconds, from Toronto,
      Canada. Keep in mind that some servers may use signcode colors for the
      MOTD and player sample. Your application should handle this. The player
      sample is often used for advertising, so take it with a grain of salt. The
      Bedrock API response is the same, with the caveat of never returning the
      icon. The bedrock player list may also be synthetic.

      There is also a Mojang Services API, at
      <a href="/api/services">/api/services</a>. This is useful for checking if
      the authservers or Xbox Services are having issues. Example response
      below. The possible values for each field are
      <code>DefiniteProblems</code>, <code>PossibleProblems</code>, and
      <code>Operational</code>.
